          <p>
              Steve came from a planet just outside of the Milky Way galaxy. He was an explorer that enjoyed vititing and camping out on other planets. 
          </p>
          <p>
              However, when Steve heard that Earth was no longer going to consider Pluto a planet, he decided to take matters into his own hands. He jumped on his spacecraft and headed to Earth. Upon arrival, Steve ended up crashing and getting a concussion.

              Now Steve spends his days giving everyone the best advice he can, even if his brain is a little jumbled!
