          <p>
              Steve came from a planet just outside of the Milky Way galaxy. He was an explorer that enjoyed vititing and camping out on other planets.

              However, when Steve heard that Earth was no longer going to consider Pluto a planet, he decided to take matters into his own hands. He jumped on his spacecraft and headed to Earth. Upon arrival, Steve ended up crashing and getting a concussion.

              Now Steve spends his days giving everyone the best advice he can, even if his brain is a little jumbled!
